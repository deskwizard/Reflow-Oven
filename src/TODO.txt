* = WIP / Partial implementation


setpointHigh extern in keypad.cpp

Todo list (mandatory):
    -   Figure out why the serial PID setting doesn't work
        but works in the PID loop.

    -   Fan pin high on boot (Boot pin ?)
            -   Option A: Use it for HOTA or HOTB instead since it won't do anything
                          without the SSR activated.

            -   Option B: Not caring.

    -   Keypad debouncing
            - Would modifying the usual debounce code for 16 bits work
              with the matrix?

    -   PID

    -   Cooldown time control



Todo list (might as well):

    -   Smooth fonts

    -   Icons (fan, little heating waves, etc...)

    -   Re-wire & replace the buzzer on the control board for
        a 12V model instead of 5V 


Optional ideas:
    -   OTA
    -   BT debug printing
    -   Value control over serial/bt for testing
